# Walkthrough - Neon PostgreSQL Integration

I have successfully switched the database from a local Docker container to a cloud-hosted Neon PostgreSQL instance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Configuration
Updated the [appsettings.json](file:///e:/Users/Haider/Documents/Source/Practice/MatechoTest/GeneralLedgerService/appsettings.json) file with the Neon connection string using the `development` branch of your `MatechoTest` project.

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Host=ep-quiet-bonus-ahvkijol.c-3.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech;Database=neondb;Username=neondb_owner;Password=***;Port=5432;SSL Mode=Require;Trust Server Certificate=true"
}
```

### 2. Neon Connection Retrieval
I used the `neonctl` CLI to:
- Identify your organization: `org-blue-band-05228507`
- Locate the project: `cold-violet-32243113` (MatechoTest)
- Retrieve the connection string for the `development` branch.

## Verification
- Task list has been updated to reflect completion.
- [appsettings.json](file:///e:/Users/Haider/Documents/Source/Practice/MatechoTest/GeneralLedgerService/appsettings.json) has been verified as updated.

You are now ready to run your migrations or start the application!
